L31 Detention of persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia with whom KFOR forces come into contact in the execution of their assigned tasks is authorised.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Use of Force.  The amount of force used in situations where use of force is authorised is to be based on the judgement of the Appropriate Unit Commander or individual on-scene commander consistent with the requirements of Military Necessity and Proportional/Minimum Force as outlined in this Annex.

Detention of Hostile Forces / Belligerents or Civilians.    Once detained, hostile forces/belligerents or civilians will be disarmed, if necessary, and at the discretion of the on-scene commander, either released or removed to designated sites for hand-over to military police for eventual transfer to an appropriate representative of UNMIK or another appropriate agency as determined by COMKFOR, as soon as possible. Up until the detained person is handed over to UNMIK or another appropriate agency, the on-scene commander may release any detainee, if in his judgement, it is appropriate to do so. All detained persons shall be treated humanely and in accordance with internationally recognised standards of human rights.

Detention of Persons Indicted for War Crimes (PIFWC).   Once detained, persons indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) shall be handed over as soon as is practicable to a representative of the Tribunal.  At the latest, this transfer should take place within 48 hours of the initial detention.

d.  Warning Shots. When authorised by ROE, warning shots may be fired whenever, in the opinion of the on-scene commander:

(1) They would deter an armed hostile or potentially hostile individual or group or forces or belligerents from obstructing the mission, or from threatening the safety of members of friendly forces, PDSS, or vehicles under his command.

(2) It is necessary for the execution of the mission to manifest resolve to an armed hostile or potentially hostile individual or group or hostile forces/ belligerents.

(3) They would deter or prevent a civilian individual, group or crowd, which poses a threat to the safety of members of friendly forces, PDSS or force property under his command, from engaging those forces, PDSS or force property.

e.  Riot Control Means.   Subject to sub-paragraph 6.a. of this Appendix, riot control means may be employed against non-belligerents at the discretion of the Appropriate Commander whenever, in his judgement, the use of armed force or warning shots would be inappropriate and:

(1) The safety of friendly forces or PDSS is threatened; or,

(2) Vehicles or property belonging to friendly forces or PDSS are similarly threatened; or,

(3) the passage of friendly forces, PDSS, vehicles, or property with designated special status under his responsibility is blocked by civilians and in his judgement, the use of armed force or warning shots is not, at that time, necessary.

f.  Prevention of Serious Crimes.

(1) When authorised, appropriate measures, up to and including the use of deadly force, may be used to prevent serious crimes in the following circumstances:

(a) The ROE permit the use of force to protect PDSS against hostile acts and against forces demonstrating hostile intent.  Therefore, COMKFOR may extend KFOR protection to specific groups or individuals whom he perceives to be under threat.

(b) ROE L26 permits the use of minimum force, against an individual who unlawfully commits, or is about to commit, an act which endangers life, or is likely to cause serious bodily harm, in circumstances where there is no other way to prevent the act.

(2) The ROE permit the on scene commander to detain civilians who commit or threaten to commit  a serious crime in the presence of a member of friendly forces or to detain hostile forces/belligerents who commit or threaten to commit serious crimes against friendly forces.

(3)    All suspected serious crimes must be reported to the chain of command.

g.  Provide Active Support.  For the purpose of ROE L24, "provide active support" means any action which directly or substantially contributes to the hostile act by hostile forces/belligerents against friendly forces, for example, a forward artillery observer/air controller directing ground or air fire.

4.  LIMITATIONS. Unless directed by COMKFOR or CINCSOUTH or in cases of self-defence there is no authority to:

a.  Fire at religious buildings or facilities, museums, or cultural or historic works.

b.  Fire into areas, buildings or houses populated by civilians.

c.  Destroy bridges, tunnels, dams, or dikes.

d.  Use herbicides except for the control of vegetation within or around the defined perimeters of the compound of friendly forces.

5.  PROHIBITIONS.   It is prohibited to:

a.  Use any incendiary weapon (this does not include use of ammunition such as white phosphorous used solely for target marking or identification, where incendiary purpose is not intended).

b.  Employ a means of delivery of mines that cannot be directed at a specific military objective.

c.  Employ a means of delivery of mines which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.

d.  Employ booby trap devices.

e.  Destroy civilian buildings not being used for military purposes except where such destruction has been authorised under ROE.

6.  SPECIFIC GUIDANCE.

a.  Weapons/Weapon Systems Restrictions.   The use of certain weapons and weapon systems is delegated to Appropriate Commanders as shown in the table below.

b.  Controlled Weapons/Ordnance.   The use of the following weapons systems and ordnance is to be strictly controlled as shown:

(1) Unattended Weapons.    Unattended means of force, including booby traps, are prohibited except that land mines could be authorised by ROE, in which case they are subject to the restrictions in sub-paragraphs 5.b. and 5.c. above and they are to be fenced and clearly marked, remotely controlled or self-destructing/self-deactivating as applicable.  In addition, they should be recorded and monitored and then cleared on completion of the military operation as appropriate.

(2) Lethal or Incapacitating Chemical Weapons.   The use of such weapons is prohibited. However, riot control means are not included within this category. When authorised, riot control means may be employed, but only as authorised above or in self-defence.

c.  Air Operations in Support of the Mission.   Air support provides an important degree of security to deployed friendly forces, particularly when faced with significant hostile forces/belligerents. The ROE for air forces operating in support of the mission are at Appendix 3 (Air ROE).

d.  Authority To Search.   Persons, vehicles, and property may be searched in the following situations and under the procedures set out at Tab C:
